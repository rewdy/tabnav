h1. jQuery Tabnav Plugin

h2. Overview

This plug in is designed to easily and unobtrusively turn a block of content into a tabbed content area. The basic funtion is it turns headings into tabs and hides all the sections but the first.

h2. Implementation

The first step is to set up your HTML markup properly. Here's the basic HTML layout:

bq. @<div id="tab_holder">@
@<div class="tab_area">@
@<h3>Tab Heading</h3>@
@<p>Tab content.</p>@
@</div>@
@<div class="tab_area">@
@<h3>Second Tab Heading</h3>@
@<p>Tab content.</p>@
@</div>@
@</div>@

After your markup is in the proper format, just call the plug in.

bq. @$(function(){@
@$('.tab_area').tabnav();@
@});@

Then that's it. There are a variety of options available for customizing, but there's the basic implementation.
